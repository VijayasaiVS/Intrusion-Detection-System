## **Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning**
 
The main objective of our project is to detect the network intrusion vulnerabilities by analyzing the given data of the network connection.

**Features:**
		
 - Identification of common network intrusion (R2L, DoS, U2R, Probe) 
 - Downloading the predicted Result
 - Downloading the summary report
 - Visualizing the result summary using plotly 
 - Accurate prediction of Results
 

**Tools Used:**

 - Python	 
					 -	Python is a general-purpose interpreted and high-level programming language. Since It supports various functional and structured programming modules we have chosen this tool to get high efficiency.   
					 -	In this project we have used python for detecting the intrusion using the machine learning algorithm

 - HTML CSS JS  
		 - We have used  Hypertext markup language ,Cascading style sheet and JavaScript for designing and developing the front end for our framework. 
  
 - Pandas   
		 - Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
		 
 - Python flask     
		 - Flask is a web application framework written in python. we have used python flask for routing and handling of the request in the backend.

 - Pycaret
		 - Pycaret is a python module that is used for performing various machine learning tasks. 

	 
 - Vscode
		 - Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes
